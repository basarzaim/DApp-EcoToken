# DApp-EcoToken

## 📌 Project Description  
DApp-EcoToken is a **decentralized application (DApp)** designed to reward users for performing environmentally friendly activities. The project consists of:  

- **Smart Contracts** (Solidity) for the token logic (minting, transferring, etc.).  
- **Backend** (Node.js/Express) to handle business logic (work-in-progress).  
- **Frontend** (React) for user interactions (not yet connected to backend).  

> ⚠️ The smart contracts are deployed and working, but backend and frontend are not fully integrated.

## 🚀 Features  

- ✅ **Blockchain Contracts**  
  - Smart contract-based token distribution for eco-friendly actions.  
  - Includes `AdminVerification`, `StakeholderRegistration`, and `Factory` logic.  

- ✅ **Minimal Backend (WIP)**  
  - Node.js/Express structure to handle API requests.  
  - Not yet deployed or connected.  

- ✅ **Frontend (React - WIP)**  
  - Web-based UI to display token balance and submit eco-action claims.  
  - Currently not linked to backend or contracts.
